### My nvim config
Prerequisite: install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).

This config was mostly built on ThePrimeagen's config [init.lua](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)


Most of config was left untouched, excluding several binds and LSPs. Currently,
TypeScript and Java LSPs and configurations work flawlessly
